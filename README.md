# Differentially_mutated_genes
Fisher's tests (with or without) correction for multiple testing on 2x2 contingency tables. Uses a list of genes from two populations to test if any are significantly mutated/disrupted by SVs in one population vs another. The output is a list of genes with P-values and adjusted P-values if necessary. Specifically set up to test for SVs affecting genes.
